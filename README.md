Timeline Gallery Sample
============================================

This Gallery is based upon EcoGallery which is in turn based upon the original Google's Gallery.
As such, it's not really a good idea to use this.

This version should crash less, should recycle views (thanks to [EcoGallery](https://github.com/falnatsheh/EcoGallery) and can smoothly scroll around.

Take a look at the sample, there isn't really anything fancy going on here. 

As a Perk I have added two dependencies that I use very often.

* [Picasso](https://github.com/square/picasso): To load Images the right way.

* [PullToRefresh](https://github.com/chrisbanes/ActionBar-PullToRefresh): to scroll back to the beginning.

The app has been created in Android Studio using Gradle so adding the dependencies was just "a one liner". 

Use at your own risk, in fact I wouldn't really use Android Gallery, it's too buggy.
